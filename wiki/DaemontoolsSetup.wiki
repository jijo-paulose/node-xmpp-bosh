#summary How to setup node-xmpp-bosh with daemontools

= Using Daemontools to monitor node-xmpp-bosh =

Install node-xmpp-bosh using either the instructions in [http://code.google.com/p/node-xmpp-bosh/source/browse/trunk/INSTALL.TXT INSTALL.TXT] or as mentioned in the [DebianHowTo]

Once you have completed everything till the section *node-xmpp-bosh configuration* (if you are following the [DebianHowTo]), you can follow the steps mentioned below

=== Create a symlink to bosh-server ===

If you installed node-xmpp-bosh in /root, the _bosh-server_ executable will be in _/root/node_modules/.bin/bosh-server_

`ln -s /root/node_modules/.bin/bosh-server /root`

=== Install daemontools on `*`NIX systems ===

(If you are running ubuntu, see below)

  * [http://cr.yp.to/daemontools.html Download]
  * [http://cr.yp.to/daemontools/install.html Install]

=== Install daemontools on ubuntu ===

Run `apt-get install daemontools`

=== Add daemontools to your startup scripts ===

[http://cr.yp.to/daemontools/start.html How to Start]

Be sure to replace /command/svscanboot with the output of `which svscanboot` on your machine

=== Create /etc/service ===

`mkdir /etc/service`

=== Create the BOSH startup script ===

`mkdir /etc/service/bosh`

`touch /etc/service/bosh/bosh.log`

`touch /etc/service/bosh/bosh.err`

`chmod a+rw /etc/service/bosh/bosh.err /etc/service/bosh/bosh.log`

Create a script _/etc/service/bosh/run_ with the following contents

{{{
#!/bin/bash
export PATH=/opt/node-v0.4.7/bin:$PATH
setuidgid nobody /root/bosh-server >> bosh.log 2>>bosh.err
}}}

`chmod +x /etc/service/bosh/run`

=== Manually start svscanboot (if you don't want to reboot) ===

`svscanboot &`

That's it!!
